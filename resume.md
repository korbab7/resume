<font size="5">My Background </font>
-----------
I am a geography student at Appalachian State University, pursuing a degree in Geography with a concentration in Geographic Information Systems and a minor in Biology. During my time at Appalachian State, I have developed a strong passion for GIS and cartographic design. I have gained experience with different GIS and design applications such as ArcMap, ArcGIS Pro, Adobe Illustrator, and R Statistical Software. I am particularly interested in using GIS to solve environmental and ecological issues.
